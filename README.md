# OpenHardship

OpenHardship is an open standard that aims to reduce the impacts of financial hardship by allowing Australian consumers to make repayments in a sustainable way.

## Principles

1. Privacy of consumers is paramount. All personal and financial information must be protected with the highest standards of security and confidentiality.

2. Minimise burden on consumers by creating simple, streamlined processes that require minimal effort during times of financial stress.

3. Ensure accessibility for all consumers regardless of digital literacy, language proficiency, or disability.

4. Maintain transparency throughout the hardship management process, with clear communication about options, decisions, and outcomes.

5. Uphold fairness by providing equitable treatment and consideration to all hardship requests without discrimination.

6. Foster sustainability by focusing on realistic, achievable repayment arrangements that allow consumers to meet essential living needs while addressing their obligations.

7. Preserve the dignity of consumers experiencing hardship through respectful communication and processes.

8. Establish clear accountability for all parties involved in the hardship management process.

9. Promote consistency in hardship assessment and management across different providers and industries.

10. Ensure timely responsiveness to hardship requests, recognizing that delays can exacerbate financial difficulties.

11. Empower consumers with information and tools to take an active role in managing their financial situation.

12. Support continuous improvement through systematic data collection and analysis while respecting privacy principles.
